I'm not _really_ qualified to talk about opera, am I?

- We got standing tickets. It was 3.5 hours long. Oh dear.
- Thank goodness for English subtitles.
- There are bits of it that are nice. I think, like many musical-theatre shows, it does tend to dry out a bit.
- How _does_ Valentin sing for so long after being mortally wounded? A _lot_ of suspension of disbelief was required for this.

The orchestra in the pit, though, were great.
I have to applaud the amount of energy they put into it considering the length and also that they're playing this day in, day out.

This isn't a criticism of the performance, but (like many stories from that era) the female character (Marguerite) exists mainly as a way to progress the plot of the male character (Faust).
This feels all too common...
