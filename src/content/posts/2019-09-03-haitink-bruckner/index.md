Despite the date on this post, I'm writing this on 28 June 2025.
I'm mainly doing this because it was such a brilliant moment and I want to remember it!

Beethoven was great, Ax was actually a replacement for Murray Perahia (who has had health issues for a long time).
I remember he played an encore of Schubert's A-flat major impromptu D935 No. 2, which was lovely, and also felt like a nice bridge between the Beethoven and Bruckner.

This was one of Haitink's last concerts (I think he did one more Bruckner 7 with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra before retiring) and the Proms audience obviously knew it.
This isn't my footage, but I'm pretty sure this was the concert:

He obviously struggled getting onto the podium, but once he was there, he seemed to be perfectly comfortable.
The best part of the concert, though, (and regular concertgoers will understand how hard this can be) was the complete silence after the end of the Bruckner.
Bruckner 7 doesn't end quietly: it's loud, but it's not a huge, climactic ending, it's more like a warm way of rounding off the symphony, and in some ways I feel like it's a really nice way to end a career.
