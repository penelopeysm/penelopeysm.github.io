I haven't blogged for ages.
I'm mostly writing this to keep a record of having attended this.

I actually dozed off during the Chopin ðŸ˜³

(Actually, am I the only person who doesn't get the Yunchan hype?
Like sure, the Rach 3 was good, but is he like the greatest pianist since Argerich or something?
When I listen to e.g. his Chopin etudes recording, I keep getting a feeling that he is trying to be different for the sake of being different, sometimes it works, and sometimes it just doesn't convince me.
Maybe I'll get it in a while.)

Anyway, the Strauss was exciting.
Wind machine, thunder machine, and all that.
(The thunder machine was great.)
