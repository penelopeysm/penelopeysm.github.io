I haven't blogged for ages.
I'm mostly writing this to keep a record of having attended this.

Was nice, the cello a bit too soft though in my opinion — there were many spots where he was completely inaudible and that's a bit sad because Elgar did write a number of these sections where the cello is doing something fancy but not the melody.

Rachmaninoff is nice — I remember commenting after the concert that the *Symphonic Dances* are less over-the-top sentimental Romanticism and a bit more like Prokofiev, but not edgy enough to be Prokofiev, which is nice as a listener because I often have an 'edginess budget'.
