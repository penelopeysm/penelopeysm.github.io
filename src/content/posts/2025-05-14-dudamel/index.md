I haven't blogged for ages.
I'm mostly writing this to keep a record of having attended this.

I don't think I was as impressed as I should have been by this star-studded concert, but I feel like that's always the case whenever I go into something with high expectations.
(I've consistently found that the concerts I enjoyed the most are the £5 Wigmore Hall ones.)
Don Juan was the only piece I was really familiar with (I only know the flute solo from Shéhérazade) and I think it was very energetic but it did feel rushed.
Anyway, this event was adequately covered in the press so I won't bother reviewing it properly.
